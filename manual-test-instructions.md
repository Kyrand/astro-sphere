# Manual Test Instructions for Drag & Drop Editor

## What was implemented:

1. **Removed the drag & drop box** ✅
   - The old "Drop images here or click to upload" box has been removed
   - Images now drop directly into the markdown editor

2. **Added drag & drop to markdown editor** ✅
   - You can now drag images directly onto the markdown textarea
   - Images will be inserted at the exact position where you drop them
   - Visual feedback shows when dragging over the editor (blue border)

3. **Cursor position insertion** ✅
   - Images are inserted at the exact cursor position or drop location
   - Multiple images maintain proper spacing

## To test manually:

1. **Open the editor**: Go to `http://localhost:4321/editor`

2. **Add some text**: Type some content in the markdown editor like:
   ```
   # My Post
   
   Here is the first paragraph.
   
   Here is the second paragraph.
   ```

3. **Test drag and drop**:
   - Find an image file on your computer
   - Drag it over the markdown editor - you should see a blue border appear
   - Drop it at different positions in the text
   - The image markdown `![filename.png](data:image/...)` should appear exactly where you dropped it

4. **Test visual feedback**:
   - When dragging over the editor, it should highlight with a blue border
   - When you move the cursor away, the highlight should disappear

5. **Test multiple images**:
   - Drop multiple images in sequence
   - Each should appear where you drop it with proper spacing

## Expected behavior:

- ✅ No drop zone box
- ✅ Direct dropping into markdown editor  
- ✅ Images inserted at cursor/drop position
- ✅ Visual drag feedback
- ✅ Proper markdown image syntax generated

## Technical details:

- Uses `caretPositionFromPoint()` or `caretRangeFromPoint()` to detect exact drop position
- Converts images to data URLs for immediate preview
- Maintains cursor position after insertion
- Handles multiple file drops correctly
