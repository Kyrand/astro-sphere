## Add a markdown editor
- add a markdown editor to the app.
- do not use React or another framework
- this should be at an /editor endpoint
- add an 'edit' mode
  - if in edit mode add an edit button to the articles taking the user to the editor
- the editor should allow title and other meta-data to be changed (hide this in an expandable section)
- the editor should allow images to be added by drag and drop
- new blog entries should be saved to the content/blog section
- give the editor a 'preview' option
